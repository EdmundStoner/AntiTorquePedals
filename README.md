# AntiTorquePedals
Code needed for Anti Torque / Rudder pedals

I loaded a [Library for joystick](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) into the Arduino IDE
I loaded this code into an arduino pro micro

I wired the output of a UHS 3150U hall effect transistor into Analog input 0
Any analog voltage reading from 1 to 5 volts will work
  
The [picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdmundStoner/AntiTorquePedals/main/antitorquepedal.jpg) shows the Hall effect sensor that is facing a Diametric ring magnet mounted on a 1/4" bolt that is attached to the swingarm of the pedals
